## Adding a PackageRepository to the cluster
We will be using the [kadras-packages](https://github.com/kadras-io/kadras-packages) repository for this tutorial.

Lets add the repository to our cluster using `kctrl` and a link to the `imgpkg` bundle.

```bash
$ kctrl package repo add -r kadras-packages --url ghcr.io/kadras-io/kadras-packages -n kadras-system --create-namespace                                                                                                                            
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

We can list available repositories to verify that the repo has been added.

```bash
$ kctrl package repository list -n kadras-system
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

Repositories in namespace 'kadras-system'

$ kctrl package available list -n kadras-system

Short description    X.509 certificate management for Kubernetes and OpenShift.
Long description     Adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes
                     clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those
                     certificates. It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources. It
                     will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew
                     certificates at a configured time before expiry.

## Installing a Package

Lets install one of these packages. `kctrl` creates the associated resources required by the PackageInstall to create resources on the cluster.

```bash
$ kctrl package install -i cert-manager -p cert-manager.packages.kadras.io -v 1.14.4 -n kadras-system
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

`kctrl` waits for the PackageInstall to reconcile successfully.

Users can also pass a `values.yml` file defining values to be consumed by the package using the `--values-file` flag. Let's see what values are accepted by the Cert Manager Package and supply custom values to it.

```bash
$ kctrl package available get -p cert-manager.packages.kadras.io/1.14.4 --values-schema -n kadras-system
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

Values schema for 'cert-manager.packages.kadras.io/1.14.4'

Key                             Default       Type     Description
controller.loglevel             2             integer  Number of the log level verbosity.
leader_election.lease_duration  60s           string   The duration that non-leader candidates will wait after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced by another candidate.
leader_election.namespace       kube-system   string   Namespace used to perform leader election. The default namespace needs changing in environments like GKE. More information: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/compatibility/#gke.
leader_election.renew_deadline  40s           string   The interval between attempts by the acting leader to renew a leadership slot before it stops leading.
leader_election.retry_period    15s           string   The duration the clients should wait between attempting acquisition and renewal of a leadership.
namespace                       cert-manager  string   The namespace in which to deploy cert-manager.
policies.include                false         boolean  Whether to include the out-of-the-box Kyverno policies to validate and secure the package installation.
proxy.http_proxy                ""            string   The HTTP proxy to use for network traffic.
proxy.https_proxy               ""            string   The HTTPS proxy to use for network traffic.
proxy.no_proxy                  ""            string   A comma-separated list of hostnames, IP addresses, or IP ranges in CIDR format that should not use the proxy.
webhook.host_network            false         boolean  Whether to run the webhook in the host network so that it can be reached by the cert-manager controller in environments like AWS EKS. More information: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/compatibility/#aws-eks.
webhook.loglevel                2             integer  Number of the log level verbosity.
webhook.replicas                1             integer  The number of replicas. In order to enable high availability, it should be greater than 1.
webhook.secure_port             10250         integer  The port where the webhook is exposed. The default port needs changing in environments like AWS EKS and AWS Fargate. More information: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/compatibility/#aws-eks.

It is worth noting that both the package name and version have to be supplied to view the values a package accepts as these might change across versions. `kctrl` accepts this in the `package-name/package-version` format.

Lets create a `values.yml` file that supplies a custom value for `namespace` to the installation.

```yaml
cat > values.yml << EOF
---
namespace: cert-manager-install
EOF
```
Let's update the installation to use these values.

`kctrl` creates a secret with the values defined in the file, updates the package installation to consume it and then waits for it to reconcile to the new desired state.

```bash
$ kctrl package installed update -i cert-manager --values-file values.yml -n kadras-system
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

## Deleting an added repository
`kctrl` deletes the PackageRepository and waits till it is deleted from the cluster.

```bash
$ kctrl package repository delete -r kadras-packages -n kadras-system
Target cluster 'https://192.168.64.27:8443' (nodes: minikube)

Deleting package repository 'kadras-packages' in namespace 'kadras-system'

Continue? [yN]: y

8:13:44PM: Waiting for package repository reconciliation for 'kadras-packages'
8:13:46PM: Package repository 'kadras-packages' in namespace 'kadras-system' deleted

## Congratulations!
You can now get up and running with published repositories and manage packages faster using `kctrl`.
