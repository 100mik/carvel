# Tutorial Development

## Credentials

For VMware contributors, Katacoda credentials are in the shared lastpass folder.

## Testing

Since katacoda doesn't support testing before going live, the best way to test a
change to the tutorial is copying the contents to a personal katacoda account
and deploying them there.

## Deployment

Whenever a change is made to the katacoda tutorial, the
`copy-katacoda-to-static.sh` script should be run to update the corresponding
documentation page.
