      <description>vendir supports downloading software stored as a Github release. See vendir.yml spec for how to configure.
Github API Rate Limiting ¶If your public IP address is shared by multiple machines (e.g. workstations in an office), you may run into Github rate limiting errors. vendir as of v0.8.0 supports providing &amp;ldquo;Personal access token&amp;rdquo; to increase Github API rate limits. You can specify it via an environment variable:
$ export VENDIR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=8c0a3... $ vendir sync To obtain personal access token go to Github.</description>

      <description>Overview ¶vendir sync command looks for vendir.yml file in current directory for its configuration. vendir.yml specifies source of files for each managed directory.
# Run to sync directory contents as specified by vendir.yml $ vendir sync See vendir.yml spec for its schema.
Sync with local changes override ¶As of v0.7.0 you can use --directory flag to override contents of particular directories by pointing them to local directories. When this flag is specified other directories will not be synced (hence lock config is not going to be updated).</description>
